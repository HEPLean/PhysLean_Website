# Project ideas 

Below are a list of project ideas, no matter who you are, you may attempt any of these.
You should assume that this list is up-to date. They are roughly ordered in complexity 
from easiest to hardest. If you would like to 'claim' one of these projects or 
add projects let Joseph Tooby-Smith know, 
or make a pull-request to the PhysLean [website repo](https://github.com/HEPLean/PhysLean_Website).


### The reflectionless potential in quantum mechanics 
<p class="badge badge-primary" style="background-color: rgba(129, 22, 67, 0.1);color: #690080;">Available</p> 

Formalize the properties of the [reflectionless potential](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14941) in 
quantum mechanics, following the formalization of the quantum harmonic oscillator. 

### Tight-binding model for graphene 
<p class="badge badge-primary" style="background-color: rgba(129, 22, 67, 0.1);color: #690080;">Available</p> 

PhysLean already contains the tight-binding model for a chain. This project would 
aim to generalize that to do the tight-binding model for graphene. A reference 
can be found [here](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/u.osu.edu/dist/3/67057/files/2018/09/graphene_tight-binding_model-1ny95f1.pdf). 

### Definition of the bosonic and fermionic Hilbert spaces 
<p class="badge badge-primary" style="background-color: rgba(129, 22, 67, 0.1);color: #690080;">Available</p> 

Define the Hilbert space of a single bosonic and a single fermionic particle. These 
can be found in these [note](https://souravchatterjee.su.domains/qft-lectures-combined.pdf#page23). 
Part of this will involve defining the Lorentz-invariant measure and the mass-shell manifold. 

### Quantum particle on a ring 
<p class="badge badge-primary" style="background-color: rgba(129, 22, 67, 0.1);color: #690080;">Available</p> 

Formalize the quantum mechanics of a particle on a ring, see 
e.g. the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_in_a_ring). 
See also, [this](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/479953-PhysLean/topic/QM.20particle.20on.20a.20ring/with/523260615)
Zulip discussion. 

### The two Higgs doublet model potential 
<p class="badge badge-primary" style="background-color: rgba(129, 22, 67, 0.1);color: #690080;">Available</p> 

The aim of this project would be to prove Theorem 1, 2 & 4 of this
[arXiv(hep-ph):0605184](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0605184). This is related to the 
two Higgs doublet model, which corresponds to a model of the universe with a proposed 
extra Higgs doublet. 

### Properties of grand unified theory groups 
<p class="badge badge-primary" style="background-color: rgba(129, 22, 67, 0.1);color: #690080;">Available</p> 

Prove the group theoretic properties of the grand-unified theories: SU(5), Spin(10) and Pati-Salam, 
as they appear in [this note](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/guts.pdf).
Some of these results appear on the [todo list](/TODOList).
